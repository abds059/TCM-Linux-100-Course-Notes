# Sudo Overview

- `sudo` stands for **Super User Do**
- Enables us to get root level user privileges

- Example command : `sudo apt update`

    Before sudo we had **root** user in linux which granted us all the permissions required for administrator level access. We still have root user in linux and can switch to it from our regular user through this command:

    `sudo su -`
