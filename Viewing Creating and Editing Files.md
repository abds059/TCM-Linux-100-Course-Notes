## Using Editors To Add Content To Files

We have two builtin editors vim and nano. Here we are going to use nano as it is a bit easy to use.

![nano file open](/IMAGES/open_nano.png)

![nano writing content in file](/IMAGES/nano_write.png)

After writing whatever we wished to add as file content we hit `Ctrl + X` and then type `Y`

![save file in nano](/IMAGES/save_file.png)

After hitting enter the nano window closes and you are back to the terminal

### Using `mousepad` As A Replacement Of nano

We also have a graphical notepad called mousepad which we can invoke by the command: `mousepad <filename>`
